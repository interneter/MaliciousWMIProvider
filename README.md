# MaliciousWMIProvider
PoC for malicious code executed every given interval using WMI without any wmi-consumer.
This is a sample code taken from Microsoft docs with several msg.exe executions under many functions.
the magic happens in the mof files, when the COM object compiled and registered.

That's an idea, nothing more. No code was written.
